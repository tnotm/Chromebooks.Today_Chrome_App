# Chromebooks.Today_Chrome_App

## What?

Chromebooks Today is a weekly podcast where Chrome OS news and views collide. This project is an attempt at creating what could potentially be an app for listening to the podcast on a Chrome device. If this sounds purposefully vague, that is entirely intentional. For now, we're considering this an experiment, and we won't at all be surprised if we end up with a monster we have an ethical obligation to put down.
